                    In this endeavor, the onus is on teachers to adopt personalized learning and teaching patterns.
                    Flexibility in learning is the keyword that governs the forthcoming tendency of imparting quality
                    education to students.

                Education can be thought of as the transmission of the values and accumulated knowledge of a society. In
                this sense, it is equivalent to what social scientists term socialization or enculturation.
                Children—whether conceived among New Guinea tribespeople, the Renaissance Florentines, or the middle
                classes of Manhattan—are born without culture. Education is designed to guide them in learning a
                culture, molding their behaviour in the ways of adulthood, and directing them toward their eventual role
                in society. In the most primitive cultures, there is often little formal learning—little of what one
                would ordinarily call school or classes or teachers. Instead, the entire environment and all activities
                are frequently viewed as school and classes, and many or all adults act as teachers.

                Transforming education in India
            </p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">
                In ancient times, India had the Gurukula system of education in which anyone who wished to study went to
                a teacher's (Guru) house and requested to be taught. If accepted as a student by the guru, he would then
                stay at the guru's place and help in all activities at home. This not only created a strong tie between
                the teacher and the student, but also taught the student everything about running a house. The guru
                taught everything the child wanted to learn, from Sanskrit to the holy scriptures and from Mathematics
                to Metaphysics. The student stayed as long as she wished or until the guru felt that he had taught
                everything he could teach. All learning was closely linked to nature and to life, and not confined to
                memorizing some information.

                The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for
                India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should
                quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars,
                unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country
                like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education(
                somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….For example, financial
                technologies or biotechnology or behavioural economics, all are major upcoming fields from different
                subject specializations.
